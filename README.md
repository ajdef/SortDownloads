# SortDownloads 
A simple Python Script that will take the contents of my downloads folder (or any folder specified), and sort each file into folders based on what file type/extension is present. I used this as my first dip into writing Python for the sake of utility. 

The current implementation is not ideal as the source location is hard-coded. I want to eventually rewrite it to take paramters, potentially using a .txt file to store the dictionary assignments, allowing the user to, at execution time, specify new file types and corresponding folder name(s).
